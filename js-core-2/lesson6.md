# Built in constructor functions and methods

In the first lesson we learnt about some of the data types available in JavaScript: 'String', 'Boolean', 'Array', 'Object' and 'Number'.

So far we've learnt how to create data using literal syntax. For example to create a string you can write


```js
var myString = 'Hello';
```

And to create an array:

```js
var myArray = ['hello', 1, 2];
```

And an object, just for fun:

```js
var myObject = {
  name: 'Daniel',
  age: 10,
  interests: ['JavaScript', 'Cycling']
};
```

This is the best way to create new data, but it's helpful to know that you can also create new data using the `new` operator and a built in constructor function.

For example, you _could_ also create a new string like this:

```js
var myString = new String('Hello');
```

Or an array:

```js
var myArray = new Array(1,2,3);
```

> Do not actually create data using this approach in practice. These examples are for learning purposes only!

`String` is a constructor function just like the constructor functions we learnt to write in the previous session, and `myString` is an instance of `String`. (Kinda cool how JavaScript is built on JavaScript, huh?!)

When you check what a string looks like created in this way, things get a bit weird though:

```js
var myString = new String('Hello');
console.log(myString);
```

Will log:

```js
String {
  0: "h",
  1: "e",
  2: "l",
  3: "l",
  4: "o",
  length: 5,
  [[PrimitiveValue]]: "hello"
}
```

Whoa! What happened to my string?! Why does this happen? Why isn't `myString` just `'hello'`?

The first reason is that, if you remember back to the previous session, constructor functions create objects. Calling `new <Constructor>` always returns an object.

The second reason is that any objects a constructor creates can be given methods, and methods for built in data types turn out to be extremely useful.

> Recap: methods are functions that belong to an object

We can try calling some of the methods given to strings.

```js
myString.toUpperCase(); // hello
myString.split(''); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
myString.endsWith('o'); // true
```

You might also have noticed that our instance of `String` also has a `length` property, so we can go ahead and find out the length of our string:

```js
myString.length; // 5
```

Before we move onto the next section, just remember that the purpose of this lesson was to improve our understanding of how JavaScript work. You don't need to actually create data using `new String()` to get access to all the methods provided by `String` (JavaScript does this for you behind the scenes).


**Exercises**:

- Create a string using literal syntax and call the `.toUpperCase()` method on it
- Create an array and call the `.push()` method on it
- Create a string using the built in `String` constructor function and note any differences from using literal syntax
- Call a method e.g. `.toUpperCase()` on a string you created using the `String` constructor function

Learn about split and join

# Inheritance using Constructor.prototype

In the previous lesson we learnt how to write methods like this:

```
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.greeting = function greeting() {
    alert('Hello my name is ' + this.name);
  }
}
```

Using this approach, every time that `Person` is instantiated, a new `greeting` function is created. If you create a `new Person()` 100 times, 100 `greeting` functions will be created for each one. This seems wasteful considering all the `greeting` functions are exactly the same.

One way to solve this is using _prototypal inheritance_. That sounds a bit scary so let's take it a step at a time.

We can say that a property is inherited when it is passed down from a parent. For example, perhaps one of the properties your parents passed to you was being really good looking. You might say that it's a family trait.

In JavaScript, there are 2 ways that a new objects receives properties. The first is _copying_, the way we've being doing it so far: inside the constructor function properties are added to the new object (`this`) when it is created. The properties are inherited from the (parent) constructor function, butÂ once the object has been created the constructor function cannot change it.

### `prototype`

The other way that objects can receive properties from their constructor function is by _inheritance_. This happens via the constructor function's `prototype`, which is an object containing hidden properties and methods.  

> Exercise

> Open up the console in your web browser and type in `String.prototype`. An object with will be returned. If you expand this object you'll see that it contains several hidden methods.

> You can also search on the internet for "String prototype", "Array prototype" etc. and find documentation for the associated methods.

When you create a new object, a hidden link is made between the new object and it's constructor function's `prototype`.

We can test that this link exists in our browser's console:

```js
function MyConstructor () {}
var myObj = new MyConstructor();
Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true
```

Let's add a method to our constructor function's prototype:

```js
MyConstructor.prototype.greeting = function () {
  console.log('Hello');
}
```

The `greeting` method will now be inherited by objects created with `MyConstructor`.

```js
var myObj2 = new Constructor();
myObj2.greeting(); // Hello
```

Remember that when objects are created a link between them and their constructor is created? Well, even though `myObj` was created before we added the `greeting` method, `myObj` is linked to `MyConstructor.prototype`, so it will inherit the newly created method as well.

```js
myObj.greeting(); // Hello
```

Both `myObj` and `myObj2` inherit properties from `MyConstructor` via _prototypal inheritance_.

```js
Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj) === Object.getPrototypeOf(myObj2) === MyConstructor.prototype; // true
```

### The prototype chain

When you access a property of an object, JavaScript first checks if the object has such a property itself. If it does it will use that. If not, it will check the object's prototype.

```js
function Person (name, formal) {
  this.name = name;
  if (formal) {
    this.greeting = function () {
      console.log('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
    }
  }
}

Person.prototype.greeting = function () {
  console.log('Hey, it\'s ' + this.name);
}

var alice = new Person('Alice');
// No greeting method on alice
console.log(alice); // { name: 'Alice' }
alice.greeting(); // Hey it's Alice

var bob = new Person('Bob', true);
// bob was instantiated with a greeting method
console.log(alice); // { name: 'Bob', greeting: function() {} }
bob.greeting(); // Hello, my name is Bob
```

# Array methods and callbacks

The most useful built in methods in JavaScript are the `Array.prototype` methods. Every array has access to these methods (because Arrays are created by the `Array` constructor function they inherit the the properties of `Array.prototype`).

Of particular use are the `Array` methods that enable you to _iterate_ over an array. We've covered iteration already when we learnt how to use `for` loops. Well, I have some amazing news for you - you will probably never need to write a `for` loop again!

Let's take a look at `Array.prototype.forEach` first. This is pretty much a straight replacement for `for` loops.

```js
var myArr = [1,2,3];

myArr.forEach(function (item) {
  console.log(item);
});

// 1
// 2
// 3
```

OOOOF! Wasn't that glorious?! Much nicer than writing a `for` loop! So how exactly does this work? `forEach` _iterates_ over each item the array. For each item is calls a function - the one that was provided as an parameter to `forEach`.

## Callback functions

Functions that are provided as parameters to another function are called _callback functions_. Often we will write these functions inside the function call like did in the `forEach` example, but we can also pass in reference to an already defined function:

```js
function callback(item) {
  console.log(item);
}

myArr.forEach(callback);
```

Whether you define your function beforehand or write it straight into the function call will depend on whether you intend on re-using that callback again. 

## More array methods

.map()
.filter()

## Chaining methods

```js
var transformedArr = myArr
  .sort()
  .map(function (item) {
    return item * 2
  })
  .filter(function (item) {
    return item < 10
  }));
```

Reusuable callbacks.

```js
var transformedArr = myArr
  .sort()
  .map(double)
  .filter(lessThan10);
```

# Intro to ES6
ECMAScript 2015 (or ES6) is a significant update to JavaScript that introduces new syntax for writing complex applications including classes and modules and other features.

## const and let
on JS Bin, let's write this simple code snippet
```javascript
function sayGreeting(name, gender) {
    var greeting = 'Hello';
    var nameWithTitle;
    if (gender === 'female') {
        nameWithTitle = 'Ms. ' + name;
    } else {
        nameWithTitle = 'Mr. ' + name;
    }
    return greeting + name;
}
// sayGreeting('Rares', 'male') should return 'Hello Mr. Rares'
// sayGreeting('Irina', 'female') should return ' Hello Ms. Irina'
```
> Exercise: Let's update this code to use `let` and `const` instead of `var`

## Template literals

> Exercise: We do a lot of string concatenation in JavaScript - ES6 introduces a more elegant way of accomplishing the same. Let's try it.

## Arrow functions
> Exercise: ES6 also has a new way of declaring functions. Let's see how it works.

> Exercise: Refactor the previous code to have a separate function that checks if gender is 'female' or not, and use it in sayGreeting. Let's try and make the code as compact as possible together using ES6 features.

## More ES6
There are so many features in ES6. They're mostly what we call `syntax sugar`. They don't provide new functionality, but new (more elegant) ways of accomplishing the same tasks.

Since not all ES6 features are supported in all browsers, many developers and projects use what is called `Transpilation` - a process that transpiles/translates ES6 code to ES5 syntax that is supported by all browsers.

On Node, most ES6 features are now natively supported in Node 8.

> From now on, we expect you to use ES6 syntax in your assignments and the code you write.

# TDD again

> Exercise: Clone the repo https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-core-2-exercises

> Let's talk about TDD again?
> 1. Why do we do TDD
> 2. How do we run the tests? Read some of the tests
> 3. Notice we're separating our tests from our code now. We are making use of **modules**
> 4. Also notice the **coverage**

## How do modules work?

So far, all our programs have been in their own single files. But Node programs can become really large, and having all our code in only one file will not be maintainable.

We can therefore split our code into so-called *modules*. A module is basically a JavaScript file that makes its functionality available to other modules and programs.

## Creating modules, exporting code

It is really simple to take existing JavaScript code and turn it into a module by exporting its functionality:

```js
function printName(name) {
  console.log("My name is " + name);
}

module.exports = printName;
```

The key here is the line containing `module.exports`. As you see, this is an assignment, and whatever is assigned to `module.exports` will be made available to other modules and program when this file is imported.

## Using modules, importing code

But how do we make use of another module in our program? We need to *import* it, and this is done using a function called `require()`.

> There are different module formats for JavaScript. The one we are using here, which is natively supported by Node, is called **CommonJS**.

```js
var printName = require('./printName.js');
```

> The string passed to the `require()` function is a _path_ to the file you are importing. `./` signifies the current directory, so the above command will import a file called "printName.js" that is in the same directory as our program.

Assuming our program is in the same folder as `printName.js`, we can use the above code to import the functionality provided by that module and store it in the `printName` variable.

We can then continue to use the `printName` function as if it we defined it in our own program!

```
var printName = require('./printName.js');

printName();
```

> Modules can not only export functions, but all variable types you already learned about. Most commonly, they export a function or an object containing multiple functions.

> *Together:* Edit the file `modules/main.js` and follow the instructions.

## Separating code and tests

Exporting and importing modules is really useful for testing, too.

As a rule of thumb, we never want to mix our actual code with our tests. It is therefore common to put them in separate files. We are going to call the file containing the tests after the file containing the code to be tested, just appending `.test` at the end of the filename. Like so:

```
main.js               # Our main program
main.test.js          # Tests for our main program
someOtherCode.js      # A module called "someOtherCode"
someOtherCode.test.js # Tests for the "someOtherCode" module
```

> The naming is really up to convention - you can even put your tests in a different folder! However, for Jest it is important to call test files "\*.test.js".
