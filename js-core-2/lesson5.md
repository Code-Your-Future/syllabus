## Good Design
- Ease of Maintenance / Clarity
    - Naming
    - Formatting
    - Commenting
    - Clear logic
    - Concise
    - Redundancy
- Reusability
    - DRY
    - Single Reponsibility
        - Avoiding global state (scope)
        - Predictability and Ease of testing
- Extensibility

> Exercise
We have some problem to solve, write really bad code that gives the right result. Tell us why it is bad.
