## CV

### Best practice

- Keep it short and concise, 1-2 pages maximum
- Put your details at the top. Only these details are necessary:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone number
  - Your city (not your full address since this is personal information! If they need it they'll ask for it later)
- Use the following sections, and only populate them with relevant details starting from the most recent first
  1. Summary (optional)
  2. Skills
  3. Employment
     - Use action verbs for each bullet point (see: <https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/action-verbs-to-make-your-resume-stand-out>)
     - Show your accomplishments, with numbers if you can (e.g. Improved landing page time to interactive by 50%)
  4. Education (this can go above Employment if the last thing you did was education and not work)
  5. Personal projects
  6. Interests (optional)

## Personal projects

Personal projects are a good way to build up your portfolio of code projects on Github.
They are very useful for employers to see how you code and also demonstrate your enthusiasm.
