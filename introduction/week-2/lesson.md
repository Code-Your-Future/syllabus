# Week 0.2

## Code.org review

How was the homework? Any questions?

We will review some exercises from [Code.org](https://code.org/).

## Programming concepts

In the Code.org exercises, you were introduced to various programming concepts.
Some of them were:

- Sequence
- Variables
- Branching
- Loops
- Functions

These concepts are the foundations of programming, and it is important that you understand them well!
We will cover them briefly now so that you become familiar with them, then we will talk about them in depth in the JavaScript modules. 

Pseudocode exercise?

## Pair programming

Pair programming is something we sometimes do in the industry.
It is when two programmers work together on one computer.
A benefit of pair programming is knowledge sharing, particularly in a scenario where a student is pairing with a mentor.

We will now do some pair programming.
