# Week 0.1

## Introduction to CodeYourFuture

Welcome to CodeYourFuture and to the world of web development!
Over the next nine months you will learn the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Modern front-end development with [React](https://reactjs.org)
- Backend development using [Node](https://nodejs.org/)

We will finish with a four-week long graduation project where you will combine everything you have learned to create a real world web application.

We will follow the [house rules](/others/house-rules.md) for the classes.

### Graduation presentation

Now you will hear from CYF graduates about their journey into software development.

## Ice breaker activity

We will now stand up in a circle so that mentors and students are evenly spread.
Spend the next 10 minutes speaking to our neighbour so that if you are a student you are speaking to a mentor.
Get to know each other!
Then afterwards we will introduce ourselves to the circle as though we are our neighbour!

## Introduction to your machine

We will spend the afternoon getting you acquainted with your machine which you will spend the next nine months with.
It is important that you get on well with your machine!

### Introduction to Ubuntu

Alastair TBD

### Introduction to VS Code

TBD

It can be easy to make spelling mistakes when coding.
Let's install a [spell checker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) which will help reduce the number of errors made coding.

### Introduction to Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a team communication tool that we will use to communicate with each other throughout the whole course.
Let's go through some exercises to get acquainted with Slack.

#### Channels

Topics are organised in different channels.

Exercises:
- Find the \#scotland-fun-stuff channel. This is where we organise fun things!
- Find the \#random channel. This is where we post random stuff!

#### Emojis

Emojis make it easy to engage with other people's comments without needing to write a reply.

Exercises:
1. A mentor will now post a random message on Slack. Give it a thumbs up to show that you have read the message!
2. A mentor will now post the name of food that they like. Give it a thumbs up if you like it or a thumbs down if you don't like it!

#### Threads

If everyone replies in the channel then it can get very messy when there are multiple conversations happening at the same time.
To make conversations more organised, we write replies in threads.
This way, a single conversation stays in one thread.

Exercises:
1. A mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite food is. Reply in a thread with your favourite food!
2. A mentor will now post a message asking what your favourite hobby is. Reply in a thread with your favourite hobby!

For bonus points, react with an emoji to your classmate's answers!
