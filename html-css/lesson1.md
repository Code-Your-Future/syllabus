**Separation of Concerns:** In computer science, separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. (Wikipedia)

> **Principles** - During the course, we will highlight principles that apply to the specific topic but also to Computer Science and Programming in general. It is important to understand these principles, terms and apply them to your thinking in general.

## Code Walkthrough

In today's class, we will begin adapting styles on this example website. We'll review some of the HTML/CSS basics you already encountered during your application process and learn some new techniques. By the end of the third lesson, we will have worked together to improve the example site on the left so that it looks like the screenshot on the right.

<a href="assets/screenshot-start.png" target="blank">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-start.png" style="border: 1px solid #bababa; width: 48%; max-height: 293px">
</a>
<a href="assets/screenshot-complete.png" target="blank">
  <img src="assets/screenshot-complete.png" style="border: 1px solid #bababa; width: 48%;">
</a>

The example website you'll begin working with is available [on Github](https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/bikes-for-refugees).

In order to get started, please [fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on Github, so it shows up under your account. Then [clone it](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) in your terminal and open it with VS Code (our chosen IDE).

> **Further reading** Let's refresh how HTML tags are structured - https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp

> **Exercise (pair programming)**: Pair with another student. One will be typing into the computer (they will be `driving`), the second will be helping out. The person who is driving will create a new repository in their Github account. This repository will contain an empty website. Add the necessary HTML and CSS in order to re-create the top level of the 'bikes for refugees' website: icon, menu links and 'Donate now' button.

## Semantic HTML

When writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.

> Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or **meaning**, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

We'll cover the following semantic tags:

  - ``<header>``
  - ``<footer>``
  - The ``role="main"`` attribute
  - ``<nav>``
  - ``<article>``
  - ``<aside role="complementary">``

> **Exercise (pair programming):**  Switch between the person who is driving and the one who is helping out. The person who is now driving will `fork` the repository and `clone` it to their computer. Add the gray section with the text 'Bikes for Refugees' and the two buttons. Update the website to use semantic tags.

## CSS Selectors

During your application process, you became familiar with CSS selectors. We'll review the basic selectors and then practice combining these to modify our button styles.

> If you want to review the selectors, read the [Common Selectors section](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/) of this page.

> **Exercise (pair programming):** Continue working in pairs and use the [background properties](http://www.htmldog.com/references/css/properties/background/) to add a [assets/jumbotron-background.jpg](background image) to the jumbotron and change the colour of the text to white.
Change the colour of the buttons and add a hover state.

> **Exercise (stretch goal):** research css transitions and make the background colour fade in.

## CSS Inheritance

Some CSS styles applied to one element will be "inherited" by their child elements. These are usually styles which apply to the content of the elements, such as font family and color. Other properties, like margins, paddings and borders, don't get passed down to children.

> In English, the word **inherit** refers to something, like the color of your eyes, which you can receive from your parent. We use this to describe how "child" HTML elements can inherit styles from "parent" HTML elements.

We'll do two quick exercises to explore what gets inherited, what doesn't, and why.

> **Exercise (pair programming):** Now the person who is driving will create a `pull request` to the other person's repository. The other person will review the changes and merge them into his repository. The other person will now drive, after `pulling` the latest changes to his computer. Use just one CSS rule to set all of the text in the jumbotron to white. To do this, you'll need to use inheritance. Why do you think some styles, like text color, get inherited?

## Pseudo Classes

You can assign CSS rules to a class like this:

```css
.btn {
    background: #ce5f31;
}
```

There are also things called "pseudo" classes. In this section, we'll introduce you to the common pseudo classes for assigning styles to interactions, such as moving your mouse over a link.

> "pseudo" is a fancy word for "fake". We call them "pseudo" classes because they're not really there in the HTML, but the browser knows what to do with them.

Here's an example of a pseudo class which changes the color of a link when the mouse moves over it.

```css
.btn:hover {
    background: #ef7f52;
}
```

Not everyone uses a mouse. Some users will prefer a keyboard, where they can hit `tab` to move between links on a page. So that they can see where they are, you should add effects to the `:focus` pseudo class too.

```css
.btn:hover,
.btn:focus {
    background: #ef7f52;
}
```

> **Exercise (pair programming):** Add the 'Learn more' section and make each box highlighted when in a "hover" or "focus" state.

## The Cascade

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. The "cascade" is a set of rules which the browser uses to choose what to do when two CSS rules conflict. Take the following example:

```css
.btn {
    color: red;
}
.btn {
    color: blue;
}
```

Should the `.btn` be red or blue? When identical selectors are next to each other like this, the browser lets the last one override the first one. But in a real-world scenario, you may have CSS scattered across different files. To solve this, we use the cascade.

> **Exercise:** Read the section on [the cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Cascade_and_inheritance#The_cascade). Then pair up. In the example, there are two paragraphs. Pick one paragraph and explain to your partner why it has a particular background color. Then ask your partner to explain the other paragraph.

> **Exercise:** Work in pairs to give each one of the navigation menu items a red border (`#ce5f31`). This border should only appear when the mouse is hovering over it or the item has focus. Then use what you've learned about the cascade to give the first navigation menu item ("Home") a different color border.

## Box Model

In CSS, everything is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properites that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.

![Box Model. Source: MDN](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13647/box-model-standard-small.png)

> **Exercise:** Work in pairs and use the `margin` and `padding` rules to spread your navigation links out a bit wider. There should be a small gap between them and enough padding so that the border is not too tight on the text.

You may have noticed that the border you added to the navigation links causes the links to jump around when you move your mouse over them. That's because the border is adding to the width of the box model, pushing the others to the side.

You can also set a transparent border, so that it takes up the space without showing a visible border.

```css
.navlink {
    border: 1px solid transparent;
}
```

> **Exercise:** Use a transparent border so that the width of each navigation menu item stays the same even when it is hovered or focused.

> **Exercise (stretch goal):** Extract all the CSS that you would like to be able to use in other websites into a separate file. This file should be in a separate repository. Determine the URL of this file and load it alongside your original CSS file.

## Homework

1. (Est. 2 hours) Read about [advanced CSS selectors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/) and then practice by playing this [CSS selector game](https://flukeout.github.io/). It gets hard at the end, but try your best!

2. Fork this repo and follow the instructions on the README - https://github.com/Code-Your-Future/html-css-project

(If you need help with Forking - then refer back to [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))

### Optional

3. Try changing the appearance of the `bikes-for-refugees` page without touching the HTML. Can you move the sidebar to the left side of the page? Can you reverse the order of "upcoming events", by putting "help us cycle" first and "join us for our fundraiser" last?

4. Finish the stretch goal from the last exercise. Extract all the CSS that you would like to be able to use in other websites into a separate file. This file should be in a separate repository, and published under `your-username.github.io/style.css`. Determine the URL of this file and load it alongside your original CSS file in `index.html`.

## Prepare for the next class
3. (Est. 4-5 hours) Complete the first three lessons in this course on [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893). You should complete **Why Responsive?**, **Starting Small** and **Building Up**. *Don't worry if you don't have a phone you can use for Remote Debugging. You can use the browser's Device Emulation instead.*
