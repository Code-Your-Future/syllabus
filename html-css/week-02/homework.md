# Homework

1. (Est. 1-2 hours) Complete the "Common Responsive Patterns" lesson of the [Responsive Web Design Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/responsive-web-design-fundamentals--ud893) course.
2. Follow along as many videos as you can from: https://flexbox.io/ (you will need to clone this repository https://github.com/wesbos/What-The-Flexbox and under each folder you can follow along to the video)
3. (Est. 2-3 hours) Continue working on the webpage you created in last week's homework assignment. Add a sidebar to your site and move the site description into it. When viewing on a small screen, this should appear below the articles. On a larger screen, it should switch to a two-column layout with the articles and sidebar sitting side-by-side. Add at least three more articles and then convert them to a grid, so that you show 3 articles per row in a box layout.
4. (Est. 1-2 hours) Flexbox is relatively new and is not supported in older browsers. In most of your work, you'll use Flexbox. But an employer might want you to use one of the older layout strategies. Read this article to learn about [positioning content in CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/positioning-content/) using floats and absolute positioning.
