## Naming patterns

## Design frameworks

A design framework is a collection of re-usable code snippets which you can use to build a website. It is sometimes called a "design system", "style guide", or "pattern library", and will usually consist of three things:

    1. Brand guidelines define the appropriate typography, colors and logos to use.
    2. Components define re-usable code snippets for common requirements, like navigation menus.
    3. Helpers define additional code tools to construct the site, like layout grids.

Having a design framework is essential when working in large projects, as it allows developers to share code, without having to write the same thing several times. It also allows the core design elements to be changed easily. For example, if all the buttons in your website use the same CSS class, you can change their appearance simply by editing one rule.

### Examples of CSS frameworks
Larger companies use design styleguides as a daily tool, allowing them to deliver code faster and improve communication between designers and developers (which is not always easy!!).

###Â Open source frameworks

When you need to create a website very quickly, in order to test a concept, for example, there are design systems that you can use. In addition to CSS classes, they also bring Javascript functionality that works out of the box (by applying CSS classes to your elements). Explore the documentation of the frameworks below.

- [Skin >](https://ebay.github.io/skin/)

> **Exercise:** Explore the examples of CSS frameworks above. What do they have in common? What are the basic elements that all of the have?

> **Exercise:** Go back to `bikes-for-refugees` and open `index.html`. Use the web developer tools ("Inspect Element") to see which CSS classes are applied to each button (`Donate now`, `Donate a bike today` and `Volunteer`). How does the `Volunteer` button differ from the other buttons?

> Still using the developer tools, change the height of the three buttons with one line of code. Do the same for font-sizes.

> Bikes-for-refugees already includes `Boostrap`. Check its [documentation >](http://getbootstrap.com/css/) and add some elements to your page that use boostrap. For example, a [responsive image >](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images).
