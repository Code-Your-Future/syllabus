# Level 10 - Minimal features:

1. All episodes must be shown
1. For each episode, AT LEAST following must be displayed:
   1. the episode's title
   1. the season number
   1. the episode number
   1. the episode's medium-sized image
   1. the episode's summary text
1. You should combine season number and episode number into an **episode code**:
   1. Each part should be zero-padded to two digits.
   1. Example: `S02E07` would be the code for the 7th episode of the 2nd season. `S2E7` would be incorrect.
