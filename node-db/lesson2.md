# Before we start
Fork and Clone the repo - https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/express-workshop-2

# Recap

Let's have a look at the repo we've just forked.

- **Package.json**: Remember how in the last lesson we added a *package.json* file and added dependencies like *express* to it.

    - What command did we use to create a *package.json* file
    - How did we add dependencies to it?

    Today, the project comes with a package file already - this lists all the packages we need to run the project (instead of adding installed packages to the Git repo, which would take up a lot of memory, we just declare a list of dependencies in `package.json`). Now, we can run `npm install`, and the dependencies will be installed.

- **Server.js** - this is the entry point for our application. Let's walk through the code and remember what it does.
    - What is **Express Static Middleware** used for?
    - What routes are defined?
    - What **Port** does the server run on?

> Let's run the server and check it in the browser. This is what you should see on your browser:

* The theme used for this website is based on Bootstrap. You can get more open source Bootsrap-based themes from [StartBootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/)

> **Exercise**: Notice how the link to **Contact me** doesn't return a page - Let's add an enpoint to return a simple string **this is a contact page**.

# Templating
> **Exercise**: Let's change the text for the link, **Contact**, to **Contact Information**.

    - How many files do you have to change? Wouldn't be nice if we could change one file and that reflects in all pages.

At the moment, we're just serving static HTML files from the *public* folder. **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** allows us to build dynamic web pages.

> A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server that processes server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

## Websites - a small detour

What is wrong with this [website?](http://cyf-template-1.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)  

Is this one any [better?](http://cyf-template-2.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com)  

The final view is [here](http://cyf-template-3.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

So what is the point of all these?

## Template Engines
A template engine enables you to use static template files in your application. At **runtime**, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design an HTML page, as it reduces duplicate code ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)).

Some popular template engines that work with Express are **Pug**, **Mustache**, and **EJS**.

## Handlebars Templating Engine

We will use [Handlebars](https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars) as the templating engine for this class.

To add it to your project:
`npm install --save express-handlebars`

Then in your `server.js`, we need to configure the `middleware` for Handlebars.

```js

// Add this to the top of your file
const exphbs  = require('express-handlebars');

// Then these two lines after you initialise your express app 
app.engine('handlebars', exphbs({ defaultLayout: 'main' }));
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');
```

> Let's look at the folder `views/layouts/main.handlebars`

- There is a **placeholder for body** where the "body" get injected - can you find it?
- Notice the *index.handlebars*, *my-cv.handlebars* and *admin.handlebars*.


Then add these routes:

```js
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.render('index');
});
```

> **Exercise**: Add similar endpoints for `/my-cv` and `/admin`.

> **Exercise**: Let's create a template called `contact` and delete the endpoint we created earlier for `/contact` - render a view instead - similar to what we did with the previous endpoints.

> **Exercise**: Remember how we changed **Contact** to **Contact Information**? Try to change now **Contact Information** to **Get in touch**. Was it any easier? 

## Template passing info from Controller to Template
When we were using the *static* HTML pages from *public/* folder - the heading text shown on top of the page (on the photo) used to change when we go to different pages. Now that we switched to the template, we've lost that behavior as the code for this part comes from the centralised **Layout** (views/layouts/main.handlebars).

How can we imitate that behavior without having to duplicate code or serve static files? **Express** and **Handlebars** allow you to pass data between the **routes** and the **views**. Here is how we can do it:

1. Let's modify the `/` route to pass the title of the page.

    ```js
    app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.render('index', {
            title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead 
        });
    });
    ```
2. In `/views/layouts/main.handlebars`, let's use the data we're passing to the template

    ```html
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
            <div class="site-heading">
                <!-- Notice the change in the next line -->
                <h1>{{title}}</h1>
                <hr class="small">
                <span class="subheading">A modern Website built in Node</span>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

> **Exercise**: Pass the `subheading` from the route to the view as well.

> **Exercise**: Change Title to default to "My Profile" if no title was provided. Look at #if helpers for Handlebars http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html

## Partials
Handlebars allows for template reuse through partials. Partials are normal Handlebars templates that may be called directly by other templates. ([Handlebars documentation](http://handlebarsjs.com/partials.html))

Let's put the **Menu** in a partial.

1. Go to `layout/main.handlebars` and cut the `<nav>` with all its contents, and move it to a new file called `menu.handlebars` under `views/partials`.

Then to use the partial, add `{{> menu}}` in the place where you cut the original menu from.

## More Templating
There is much more that can be done with **Handlebars** templating engine. Skim through the [express-handlebars](https://github.com/ericf/express-handlebars) and [handlebars documentation](handlebarsjs.com)

For now, we will finish by using the **each** helper.

### Dynamically loading the templates

```html
{{#each posts}}
    <div class="post-preview">
        <a href="post.html">
            <h2 class="post-title">
                {{this.title}}
            </h2>
            <h3 class="post-subtitle">
                {{this.summary}}
            </h3>
        </a>
    </div>
{{/each}}
```

In the `route`, let's load the file in `data/posts.json`:

```js
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    const filePath = __dirname + '/data/posts.json';
    const callbackFunction = function(error, file) {
        // we call .toString() to turn the file buffer to a String
        const fileData = file.toString();
        // we use JSON.parse to get an object out the String
        const postsJson = JSON.parse(fileData);
        // send the json to the Template to render
        res.render('index', {
          title: 'Etzali Profile', // insert your name instead
          posts: postsJson
        });
    };
    fs.readFile(filePath, callbackFunction);
});
```

# Callbacks
In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. That means they can be used in a first class manner like any other object since they are objects themselves. We can pass them as arguments to functions which is common technique in JavaScript for dealing with **asynchronous** behaviour. We have in fact already encountered callbacks when we looked at array methods such as `.forEach()`, `.map()` and `.filter`.

```js
const evenNumbers = [2, 4, 6, 8];
evenNumbers.forEach(function( num ) {
    console.log(num);
});
```

Here we are passing the `function( num ) {console.log(num);}` function as an argument to `.forEach()` to execute with each item in the array `evenNumbers`.

The above example is **synchronous** which means that code the callback is executed immediately. Let's look at an example where the code is executed **asynchronously**. We will use a `setTimeout` function to delay execution here. In most JavaScript applications asynchronous code execution could be in response to an event such as mouse click or data coming back from a server. We will look at both of those cases in detail in a future class.

```js
function delay(callback){
    setTimeout( callback, 2000 );
}

function logRandom(){
    const value = Math.round( Math.random() * 10);
    console.log( value );
    return value;
}

delay(logRandom);
```

**Key points**
* Functions can be passed as arguments to other other function
* Functions that are passed as arguments are called **callbacks**
* Callbacks may be executed immediately or later
* If a callback is executed later, its return value is lost

> **Exercise**: What other Asynchronous operations have we recently used in the Node code we've written?

> **Exercise**: On the CV page, there is a button, **Get Repos List**, that doesn't work. There is code to make it work at `js\github-client.js`. Add `js\github-client.js` to your pages.

The **client-side code** in *github-client.js* should look familiar.

> **Exercise**: Identify all the callbacks in this code. Refactor the **anonymous functions** to their own variables and use the variables instead. (Bonus point if you use arrow functions)

## Callback hell
In the code where we retrieve the repos data from Github, imagine if we had a requirement, that for each repo retrieved, we have to make another API call to retrieve all the available branches (there is a property called *branches_url* that we can use to get that info). And then, once we have all the branches, make _another_ API call to get the info for each branch.

The code to do so, will look something similar to this:
```js
var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.addEventListener('load', function() {
    var oReq2 = new XMLHttpRequest();
    oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {
        var oReq3 = new XMLHttpRequest();
        oReq2.addEventListener('load', function() {
            // 4. Now we finally have all the info we need and we can the info we retrieved from the three API calls.

        });
        oReq3.open('GET', url); // 3. third url for branch info
        oReq3.send();
    });
    oReq.open('GET', url); // 2. second url for branches
    oReq.send();
});
oReq.open('GET', url); // 1. first url for Repo
oReq.send();
```

The code above is very hard to understand and follow. Notice the pyramid shape `})` - This is often called the **callback hell**.

# APIs
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to communicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day: **Github API**. We managed to *communicate* with Github and get important information. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different ways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a Mobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...

> **Let's** watch this video about APIs - [What is an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)

> **Exercise**: Let's expose the `posts.json` as an API for other clients to consume through the url `/api/get-posts`.
> Hint: make use `res.sendFile`

## REST API
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a way (an architecture) for building APIs that is simple and scalable.

There are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one fundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)

In our *endpoint* that we just created `/api/get-posts`, the *get* part of the URL is redundant as the HTTP Method `GET` already tells that we are *GETting* a *Resource*. The Resource in this case is called **posts**.

> Exercise: Let's rename our endpoint to `/posts` so that it follows RESTful architecture.
>
> **What would the endpoint for creating posts be called?**

> **Watch**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA - What is a REST API (up to 3 minutes)

REST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia shows how a typical RESTful API would look like.

![](assets/REST.png)
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Uniform_interface)

For now, remember when building APIs, to use **Resource** names to identify your endpoints and make use of the **HTTP methods (Verbs)** to describe operations performed on those resources.

# Deploying to Heroku

Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) that lets companies build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps. Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to focus on their core product without the distraction of maintaining servers, hardware, or infrastructure.

1. Go to https://signup.heroku.com/ and signup for an account
    - It will send a verification to your email so make sure you've entered a valid email
2. Download the Heroku CLI from https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install
3. We need to do a small tweak to our app to be ready to be deployed on Heroku.

On server.js, add the `process.env.PORT` bit of code
```js
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, function () {
  console.log("Server is listening on port 3000. Ready to accept requests!");
});
```

This tells our server to look for an **environment variable** called `PORT` and use it to run the server, otherwise use Port 3000. When the server runs on heroku, then Heroku sets the `PORT` to the correct value.

`git add` and `commit` your change.

4. Now open the command line in the folder where you have your **express-workshop** repo running. If you run the command `git remote -v`, you should see one remote **origin** pointing to your repo.

Run these commands:

`heroku login`

> This will ask you for your heroku email and password that you used to register. 

Once you're logged in:

`heroku create`

> The heroku create command creates a new application on Heroku – along with a git remote that must be used to receive your application source.

If you check `git remote -v`, you should see a second remote called **heroku**.

Now push your code to heroku `git push heroku master`. The push will run few commands from Heroku, then you should see a url similar to `https://some-random-name-XXXX.herokuapp.com` - go to the URL and if all goes well, your app should be up and running.

To read more about Heroku and deploying Node Apps to Heroku, check
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git and https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#set-up

# Homework
- Deploy to Heroku if you haven't yet
- Add a route `posts/:postid` that displays a specific post - Read about route parameters on [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters)
    - When the user clicks on a route in the home page, navigate them to your route.
    - Amend your JSON structure to have a **postId** that you can use it to identify which post we want to display.
- Implement the Admin page. 
    - Write a posts endpoint that you can hit and that should save to the JSON file (use the helper functions we added under **helpers/savePost**)
    - Make an AJAX call from the **front end** (the admin page) to your new endpoint.
    - You might need to use `formidable` or `body-parser` middleware to get the data on the server.
- Consume a posts API built by another colleague (and deployed to Heroku) to display their latest blog posts. You can display the posts on any page that you see suitable (or add a new page).
- Secure the Admin page so that it's only visible if a certain query parameter is provided
    - Can you go a bit further with adding proper security? Research the internet for solutions in **Express.js**
