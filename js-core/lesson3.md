# JavaScript Core 3
** What we will learn today?**
- Unit Testing
- TDD
- Intro to JavaScript in the browser
  - DOM
  - DOM Events

# Unit Testing
We go through the problems they've already solved in the last week, refactor and do them in a testable way - introduce TDD etc..

Why is testing important?
Different levels of testing?
Regression?

maybe we start with not using a framework at all?
We use `JEST` after

# JS in the browser

## Topic 1
High level explanation of Topic 1 - rely on the exercises

# Homework

1. First part of Homework - Easy
- write a function that returns whether a number exists in a list
Example:
    [1,2,3,4] -> does 6 exist -> false
              -> does 3 exist -> true
- write a function that concatenates two lists together
Example:
    [1,2,3], [7,8,9] -> [1,2,3,7,8,9]

- given the following object shape:

    var person = {
        name: "Bob",
        age: 25
    };

    Write a function "growOlder()" that accepts a "person" as an argument and returns a new person with his/her age increased by 1.


2. Second part of Homework:
Implement solutions to solve the following problems:

Problem 1.
Given the following array
[2,5,7,2,3], and the number T = 8
Build a solution that finds the two numbers in the array that add up to T.

Problem 2.
Think about how you would represent an employee as a JavaScript object.

Create the following functions:
- addEmployee: adds an employee to the list of existing employees
- search: allows you to search for an employee by name
- fire: deletes an employee by ID from the list
- changeRole: accepts as parameters an employee ID and a string for the new role it should have. Finds the employee by ID and changes his/her role.

3. **[Bonus/Optional]**
- Try to finish as many exercises as you can from http://reactivex.io/learnrx/ (try to finish up to exercise 8 at least)
- They're difficult, the point is for you to read, learn and understand more about the `.map` and `.filter` functions. It's okay if you can't finish them all.

# Research
1. Watch the following video on "Value type vs. reference type": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh-hPzDfb_Q .
If it makes sense, great! If not, don't worry, we'll be going over the same topic next week and discuss it until it makes sense.

2. Watch the following videos on the `.map` and `.filter` array operators:
- Map: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqtb-Z5YGQ
- Filter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk

Again, don't worry if nothing makes sense. If you don't understand something, you can Google for more information, and if it still doesn't make sense, we'll be going through these topics next week!
