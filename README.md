# Introduction
*[London Branch]*
This is the course material for [Code Your Future](http://codeyourfuture.co/), a
not-for-profit volunteer-run coding school for refugees and asylum seekers.

During the course you will learn a technology stack that helps you build anything from a simple website to a powerful database-driven web application or even a mobile app! The six-months course starts with HTML/CSS then core JavaScript, backend development using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), and modern front-end development with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Weâ€™ll complement the training with workshops on modern software methodologies and job interview practices etc...
